# = TotalSpaces - Ruby API bindings for TotalSpaces from BinaryAge
#
# == 2013-02 At present this is pre-release, there is no public version of TotalSpaces containing the API.
#
# This gem enables you to get information from and to control {TotalSpaces}[link:http://totalspaces.binaryage.com]
#
# It is the officially supported way of using the API library libtotalspacesapi, and the required dylib 
# comes bundled with this gem. This gem uses {Ruby-FFI}[link:https://github.com/ffi/ffi] to call the functions in the dylib.
# You'll need a sane ruby and compilation environment to install ruby-ffi - it probably won't install immediately with the
# ruby that comes with Mountain Lion because none of the compilation tools are present. We use {homebrew}[link:http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/]
# and {rbenv}[link:https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/] to manage our ruby scripting environment.
# {This simple guide}[link:http://jacobswanner.com/2012/07/13/ruby-1-9-3-without-gcc.html] may help if you are new to this.
#
# You may use this gem in various ways. For instance, you could:
#
# * Display a message or alert when a particular space is moved to
#
# * Automatically change the name of spaces depending on what apps are in them
#
# * Record which spaces certain windows are on, and restoring those windows to those spaces when the owning app restarts
#
# * Trigger moving certain windows between spaces
#
# API support, and support for this gem starts with TotalSpaces v1.1.4. The API is a premium feature,
# and will only work with registered versions of TotalSpaces.
#
# == Download and installation
#
# The latest version of the TotalSpaces gem can be installed with RubyGems:
#
#  % [sudo] gem install totalspaces
#
# Source code can be downloaded on GitHub
